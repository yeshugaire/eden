# Eden
Eden is a full-stack garden-management application enabling users to more efficiently care for all of their plants, whether their plot spans acres or a windowsill in their apartment. Users can access the database to add plants to their digital garden, obtain in-depth knowledge on a massive variety of plant species, and create care schedules for the plants in their garden.

The application is built on a Node.js/Express platform and uses Sequelize to power it's MySQL database. Passport.js and bCrypt-js are employed to handle user-authentication and secure sensitive data. Cheerio.js and Axios work in conjunction to scrape plant species data from https://garden.org and store it to the database. Eden uses MVC design principles and Handlebars.js as a view engine and templating framework.
